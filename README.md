### Research Data Stewards Coding Group Project

This project is using the [Latest 1000 Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nagrajdesai/latest-10000-movies-dataset-from-tmdb). Here are some project questions and ideas to consider for your Python project:

### Initial questions about the data-set from the group 

- Plot the original language of the movies 

- Find which genre has the highest average rating

- Are movie goes becoming 'tired' of big budget movies?

- Plot release date by Year/Month

- Make Barbie the most popular movie

- Find movies that have a sequal


### Time Trends:

- How has the average movie runtime changed over the years?

- Are there trends in the popularity of certain genres that have emerged over time?

### Clustering

- Can you cluster movies into different groups based on their attributes such as genre, rating, and revenue?

- What insights can you draw from these clusters?
